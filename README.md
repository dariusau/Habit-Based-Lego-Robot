# Summer Research Project - Supervised by Matthew Egbert

## Setting up
Connecting to the robot using Server/Client Socket. With the robot as the client, and desktop as the server.\
For wired setup, go to [Wired Setup](http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/tutorials/connecting-to-the-internet-via-usb/)\
For wireless setup, go to [Wireless Setup](WirelessSetup.md)

Note: It is **much better** to use dualboot since there are no added complexity, but using VirtualBox will also works with the right setup.

## How to run the client-server 
Setting up and running the client-server setup can be done by following the [tutorial](HOWTO.md).

    server: folder containing files to be able to run the server on the computer side.
    client: folder containing files to be able to run the robot and connect to the server.
